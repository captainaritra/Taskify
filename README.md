# Taskify – Todo App with Redux & LocalStorage

## 🎥 Demo Video : https://youtu.be/ETSxZqKFjNI

## 📌 Overview

Taskify is a simple yet powerful **task management application** built with **React, Redux Toolkit, and LocalStorage**. It allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks, while also persisting data in the browser so tasks are saved even after a page refresh.

This project was created as my **final project for CS50x**. It demonstrates my understanding of:

* React components and state management
* Redux Toolkit for global state management
* LocalStorage for data persistence
* Clean UI and UX with TailwindCSS and ShadCN components

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Staying organized and managing tasks efficiently can be difficult without a proper system. Many existing task apps are either too complicated or lack offline persistence.

---

## ✅ Solution

Taskify provides a **minimalist todo manager** where users can:

* Add tasks
* Edit tasks
* Delete tasks
* Persist tasks in localStorage

This ensures that the app is lightweight, user-friendly, and functional without requiring an external backend.
